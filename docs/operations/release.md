# Release Checklist

> For maintainers. Using T3 Code? See [docs/user](../user/).

This document covers the unified release workflow for stable and nightly desktop and Android releases.

## What the workflow does

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Triggers:
  - push tag matching `v*.*.*` for stable releases
  - scheduled nightly check every three hours
  - manual `workflow_dispatch` for either channel
- Runs lint, typecheck, and tests alongside artifact builds. Publishing waits for every check.
- Reads the shared production T3 Connect relay URL and Clerk client configuration before packaging clients.
- Builds five artifacts in parallel for both channels:
  - macOS `arm64` DMG
  - macOS `x64` DMG
  - Linux `x64` AppImage
  - Windows `x64` NSIS installer
  - Android APK
- Publishes one GitHub Release with all produced files.
  - Stable tags with a suffix after `X.Y.Z` (for example `1.2.3-alpha.1`) are published as GitHub prereleases.
  - Only plain stable `X.Y.Z` releases are marked as the repository's latest release.
  - Nightly runs are always GitHub prereleases and never marked latest.
  - Automatically generated release notes are pinned to the previous tag in the same channel, so stable compares to the previous stable tag and nightly compares to the previous nightly tag.
- Includes Electron auto-update metadata (for example `latest*.yml`, `nightly*.yml`, and `*.blockmap`) in release assets.
- Does not publish the upstream-owned `t3` npm package. The `publish_cli` job is intentionally
  disabled in this fork; enable it only after adopting a fork-scoped package name and update path.
- Deploys the hosted web app to Vercel only after a release is published:
  - stable releases are aliased to the `latest` hosted app channel
  - nightly releases are aliased to the `nightly` hosted app channel
- Signing is auto-detected per platform from secrets. Android always produces a signed, installable APK; without a configured release keystore it uses a one-run key and warns that the artifact cannot update another release in place.

## Android APK release signing

The Android job runs Expo prebuild and Gradle on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu, verifies the APK signature and package/version metadata, and publishes `T3-Code-<version>-android.apk` with the desktop assets. It does not require `EXPO_TOKEN` or EAS.

Configure all four secrets in the `production` GitHub environment to keep the signing identity stable across releases:

- `ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64`: base64-encoded JKS or PKCS12 keystore.
- `ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: keystore password.
- `ANDROID_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`: release key alias.
- `ANDROID_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD`: release key password.

The job fails on a partially configured secret set. When all four are absent, it creates an ephemeral signing key so CI can still publish an installable artifact. Ephemeral-key APKs are suitable for fresh installs and pipeline testing only; Android requires users to uninstall a build signed by a different key before installing it.

The production job also reads `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE`, `RELAY_DOMAIN` (or `RELAY_API_ZONE_NAME`), and optional Clerk Google client IDs from GitHub environment variables and compiles them into the mobile app.

## Required release credentials

Stable releases require these GitHub Actions secrets in addition to the platform and deployment
credentials documented below:

- `RELEASE_APP_ID`
- `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`

The GitHub Release job uses them to mint the token that publishes release assets. Stable releases use
them again in the finalize job, which can commit and push aligned package versions to `main`.

## T3 Connect relay deployment

The relay is a shared control plane versioned separately from client releases. Stable and nightly
client builds must point at the same relay so users see the same linked environments when switching
release channels.

`.github/workflows/deploy-relay.yml` deploys Alchemy stage `prod` on every push to `main`. The
release workflow reads the relay URL and Clerk client configuration from the existing `production`
GitHub Actions environment before building desktop, CLI, or hosted web artifacts.

Required repository variables shared by relay deployments:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `PLANETSCALE_ORGANIZATION`
- `AXIOM_ORG_ID`

Required repository secrets shared by relay deployments:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- `PLANETSCALE_API_TOKEN_ID`
- `PLANETSCALE_API_TOKEN`
- `AXIOM_TOKEN`

Required `production` environment variables:

- `RELAY_API_ZONE_NAME`
- `RELAY_TUNNEL_ZONE_NAME`
- `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE`
- `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE`
- `CLERK_CLI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `APNS_ENVIRONMENT`
- `APNS_TEAM_ID`
- `APNS_KEY_ID`
- `APNS_BUNDLE_ID`

Optional `production` environment variables:

- `RELAY_DOMAIN` when overriding the derived `relay.<RELAY_API_ZONE_NAME>` domain

Required `production` environment secrets:

- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `APNS_PRIVATE_KEY`

The account-scoped repository credentials are consumed by Alchemy while provisioning relay stages; they
are not bound into the relay Worker. The production deployment uses an Axiom personal access token,
so `AXIOM_ORG_ID` must accompany `AXIOM_TOKEN`. The `prod` stage owns the retained PlanetScale
database. Local personal stages provision isolated branches from it and are never deployed by CI.
Production adopts the configured relay API and tunnel DNS zones as retained Cloudflare resources.
Personal stages reference the production-owned zones.

Developers deploy personal stages locally rather than through pull-request automation:

```sh
vp run --filter t3code-relay deploy -- --stage "$USER" --env-file .env.local
```

## Hosted web app release deployment

The hosted app is intentionally not deployed by Vercel's Git integration. The
web project disables automatic Git deployments in `apps/web/vercel.ts` via
`git.deploymentEnabled: false`, and `.github/workflows/release.yml` deploys the
web app with Vercel CLI after the GitHub Release succeeds.

Required GitHub Actions secrets:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

Optional GitHub Actions variables:

- `VERCEL_TEAM_SLUG`: overrides the Vercel CLI scope when the team slug is preferred over the `VERCEL_ORG_ID` secret.
- `T3CODE_WEB_ROUTER_URL`: defaults to `https://app.t3.codes`.
- `T3CODE_WEB_LATEST_DOMAIN`: defaults to `latest.app.t3.codes`.
- `T3CODE_WEB_NIGHTLY_DOMAIN`: defaults to `nightly.app.t3.codes`.

Required Vercel domains:

- `app.t3.codes`: the router domain users open, updated by stable releases.
- `latest.app.t3.codes`: channel alias updated by stable releases.
- `nightly.app.t3.codes`: channel alias updated by nightly releases.

The router domain uses `apps/web/vercel.ts` routes. Users opt into a channel by
visiting `/__t3code/channel?channel=latest` or
`/__t3code/channel?channel=nightly`; the router stores the
`t3code_web_channel` cookie and rewrites future requests on `app.t3.codes` to
the matching channel alias.

The release deploy job rewrites release package versions before upload so the
hosted app's About panel renders the release version. Stable deploys alias the
same deployment to both the `latest` channel and the router domain so the router
rules stay current. Nightly deploys only alias the `nightly` channel. The job
also passes `VITE_HOSTED_APP_CHANNEL=latest|nightly`, which renders the hosted
update track selector in the About panel. Changing the selector navigates
through `/__t3code/channel` on the router domain so the user's channel cookie is
updated before redirecting to the hosted app root.

One-time Vercel dashboard setup:

1. Confirm the web project root directory remains `apps/web`.
2. Add the three domains above to the web project.
3. Disable automatic Git deployments in the dashboard if desired; the committed
   `vercel.ts` setting is the source-of-truth, but disconnecting Git in the
   dashboard is also safe.
4. Run one stable release deployment, or manually alias the current stable
   deployment, so `app.t3.codes` points at a deployment containing the router
   rules in `apps/web/vercel.ts`. Future stable releases keep this alias current.

## Nightly builds

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Triggers:
  - scheduled check every three hours
  - manual `workflow_dispatch` with `channel=nightly`
- Runs the same desktop quality gates and artifact matrix as the tagged release flow.
- Publishes a GitHub prerelease only:
  - current tag format: `vX.Y.Z-nightly.YYYYMMDD.<run_number>`
  - `nightly-v...` is accepted only as a legacy previous-nightly tag
  - release name includes the short commit SHA
  - `make_latest` is always `false`
- Uses the next stable patch version as the nightly base. For example, `0.0.17` produces nightlies on `0.0.18-nightly.*`.
- Publishes Electron auto-update metadata to the dedicated `nightly` updater channel, so desktop users can opt into that track independently from stable.
- Leaves CLI npm publication disabled, including for nightly builds.
- Does not commit version bumps back to `main`.

## Server self-update release invariant

The upstream workflow publishes an exact-version `t3@<version>` package for connected-server
updates. This fork intentionally disables that publication because it does not own the upstream npm
package. GitHub Releases still wait for the `quality` and `build` jobs, while `publish_cli` remains a
skipped placeholder. Do not describe remote automatic server updates as release-supported until the
fork has a separately named package and the client update command targets it.

Before enabling a future fork-owned package, validate exact-version publishing and update a server
from the previous version. When a release adds database migrations, snapshot the database first,
verify that the remote update applies the migrations and reconnects, and restore the snapshot plus
the previous server after a failed trial. If the installed launcher does not support the target
protocol, verify that the update stops before restart and document the one-time fork-scoped CLI
update command. Also test the manual and desktop-managed guidance when those environments are
available.

## Desktop auto-update notes

- Updater runtime: `apps/desktop/src/updates/DesktopUpdates.ts`.
- `electron-updater` adapter: `apps/desktop/src/electron/ElectronUpdater.ts`.
- `apps/desktop/src/main.ts` only wires the updater layers into the desktop runtime.
- Update UX:
  - Background checks run on startup delay + interval.
  - No automatic download or install.
  - The desktop UI shows a rocket update button when an update is available; click once to download, click again after download to restart/install.
- Provider: GitHub Releases (`provider: github`) configured at build time.
- Repository slug source:
  - `T3CODE_DESKTOP_UPDATE_REPOSITORY` (format `owner/repo`), if set.
  - otherwise `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` from GitHub Actions.
- Required release assets for updater:
  - platform installers (`.exe`, `.dmg`, `.AppImage`, plus macOS `.zip` for Squirrel.Mac update payloads)
  - channel metadata: `latest*.yml` for stable releases, `nightly*.yml` for nightly releases
  - `*.blockmap` files (used for differential downloads)
- macOS metadata note:
  - `electron-updater` reads `latest-mac.yml` on stable and `nightly-mac.yml` on nightly, for both Intel and Apple Silicon.
  - The workflow merges the per-arch mac manifests into one channel-specific mac manifest before publishing the GitHub Release.

### Windows payload topology and update validation

Windows packages the bundled server and only its runtime-external/native
dependency closure in `resources/server.asar`. Native modules and helper
executables declared as unpacked by that archive must be present at the matching
paths below `resources/server.asar.unpacked`. The Windows-native backend reads
the archive in place through Electron. WSL cannot read ASAR files, so enabling
the WSL backend extracts the server tree once into the desktop state directory
under `wsl-server-tree/<version>` and reuses the completed version until the app
is updated.

The artifact builder rejects a Windows package when any of these invariants
break:

- `resources/server.asar` is absent or does not contain the server entry.
- Any file marked unpacked in the ASAR header is absent from
  `resources/server.asar.unpacked`.
- On same-architecture Windows builds, the packaged primary cannot load the fff
  native library from inside `server.asar` through its `.unpacked` sibling.
- The isolated, extracted sidecar cannot load the server entry with plain Node.
- The external Windows resource monitor is absent.
- The unpacked Windows application contains more than 80 files.

Cross-architecture Windows builds retain every structural and extracted-sidecar
check, but skip executing the target Electron binary. A same-architecture build
for each release target must exercise the primary native-load probe.

NSIS differential packaging remains enabled. A sidecar layout transition can
produce a larger one-time download; subsequent small releases retain their
blockmaps, with a 60 MB maximum for a representative sidecar-to-sidecar update.

## 0) npm publication (disabled in this fork)

`publish_cli` is retained as an upstream-reference job but is guarded with `if: false`. Never enable
it for the globally named `t3` package. A future fork-owned publication must first rename the
package, update server self-update commands, configure its own trusted publisher, and validate the
complete stable and nightly paths.

## 1) Release validation and unsigned builds

There is no dry-run tag path. Pushing any accepted non-nightly tag, including
`v0.0.0-test.1`, classifies the run as the stable channel. It creates a real GitHub Release, aliases
the hosted app to `latest.app.t3.codes` and
`app.t3.codes`, and can commit a version bump to `main` in the finalize job. Do not push a test tag
to validate the workflow.

The workflow has no non-publishing `workflow_dispatch` mode. Use normal CI or local quality gates to
validate checks and builds without shipping. To exercise the complete release graph at lower stable
risk, manually dispatch `channel=nightly`; this still publishes a real GitHub prerelease, desktop
updater release, and hosted nightly alias, but it does not update stable aliases or commit a version
bump to `main`. Only run it when a real nightly release is acceptable.

Manual `channel=stable` with a version input is also a real stable-channel release. Omitting signing
secrets only makes platform artifacts unsigned; it does not prevent publication.

## 2) Apple signing + notarization setup (macOS)

Required secrets used by the workflow:

- `CSC_LINK`
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_API_KEY`
- `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`
- `APPLE_API_ISSUER`
- `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` (base64-encoded provisioning profile with Associated Domains)

Required repository variables:

- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

Optional repository variables:

- `CLERK_PASSKEY_RP_DOMAINS`: comma-separated RP-domain override. By default, the build derives the
  domain from the production Clerk publishable key.

Checklist:

1. Apple Developer account access:
   - Team has rights to create Developer ID certificates.
2. Create an explicit App ID for `com.t3tools.t3code` and enable Associated Domains.
3. Create a `Developer ID Application` certificate and a compatible provisioning profile for that
   App ID with Associated Domains enabled.
4. Export the certificate + private key as `.p12` from Keychain.
5. Base64-encode the `.p12` and store as `CSC_LINK`.
6. Base64-encode the provisioning profile and store it as `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`.
7. Store the `.p12` export password as `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, and set `APPLE_TEAM_ID` to the
   10-character Apple Developer Team ID.
8. In App Store Connect, create an API key (Team key).
9. Add API key values:
   - `APPLE_API_KEY`: contents of the downloaded `.p8`
   - `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`: Key ID
   - `APPLE_API_ISSUER`: Issuer ID
10. Complete the Clerk Native API and AASA setup in [T3 Connect Clerk Setup](../internals/t3-connect.md#desktop-passkeys).
11. Re-run a tag release and confirm macOS artifacts are signed/notarized and contain the expected
    `com.apple.developer.associated-domains` entitlement.

Notes:

- `APPLE_API_KEY` is stored as raw key text in secrets.
- The workflow writes it to a temporary `AuthKey_<id>.p8` file at runtime.
- The workflow decodes `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`, validates it with `security cms`, and passes it
  to the desktop packager.

## 3) Azure Trusted Signing setup (Windows)

Required secrets used by the workflow:

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PROFILE_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_PUBLISHER_NAME`

Checklist:

1. Create Azure Trusted Signing account and certificate profile.
2. Record ATS values:
   - Endpoint
   - Account name
   - Certificate profile name
   - Publisher name
3. Create/choose an Entra app registration (service principal).
4. Grant service principal permissions required by Trusted Signing.
5. Create a client secret for the service principal.
6. Add Azure secrets listed above in GitHub Actions secrets.
7. Re-run a tag release and confirm Windows installer is signed.

## 4) Ongoing release checklist

1. Ensure `main` is green in CI.
2. Bump app version as needed.
3. Create release tag: `vX.Y.Z`.
4. Push tag.
5. Verify workflow steps:
   - preflight passes
   - release quality checks pass
   - all matrix builds pass
   - `publish_cli` remains skipped for the upstream-owned package
   - release job uploads expected files
6. Smoke test downloaded artifacts.

## 5) Troubleshooting

- macOS build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all Apple secrets plus `APPLE_TEAM_ID` are populated and non-empty.
  - Confirm the provisioning profile belongs to `APPLE_TEAM_ID.com.t3tools.t3code` and includes
    Associated Domains.
- Windows build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all Azure ATS and auth secrets are populated and non-empty.
- Build fails with signing error:
  - Retry with secrets removed to confirm unsigned path still works.
  - Re-check certificate/profile names and tenant/client credentials.
